# Astrolabe

This is a utility for working with closed loop stepper drivers
over serial connections.

# Compiling

Create a shadow jar that can be run using `java -jar`: 

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

Create a precompiled native image:

```bash
./gradlew nativeImage
```

## Maintaining the Native Image Config

The native image is generated using Graal, which analyzes the Java code to make it more compact and performant. In order
to deal with things like reflection, the Graal compiler must be provided with configurations that describe the resources
and classes used by the application.

These configurations can be difficult to create by hand. Graal includes instrumentation to produce these configurations
automatically based on application execution though. To do so:

1. Ensure you have Graal installed
   - on OSX
     ```bash
     brew install --cask graalvm/tap/graalvm-ce-lts-java11 && \
     sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-*
     ```
     Then find your Graal installation, lets call this `$GRAAL_HOME`, and run
     ```bash
     ${GRAAL_HOME}/bin/gu install native-image
     ```
   You will need to ensure that the Graal version referenced in the gradle file matches the version you have installed.
2. Create a shadow jar using the commands in the above section
3. Run the jar with instrumentation. This will update the image config.
   ```bash
   ${GRAAL_HOME}/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=./src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image \
   -jar ./build/libs/astrolabe-all.jar <...>
   ```
   You can use `config-output-dir` instead of `config-merge-dir` to rewrite it completely. You may need to do this if 
   you change Graal versions.
4. Review the proposed changes to make sure they make sense before merging them with the source.
